# Alzheimers-prediction
# 🧠 Alzheimer’s Disease Prediction | Capstone Project

## 📌 Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of Alzheimer’s disease based on a dataset of 74,000+ patients from over 20 countries. The primary goal is to support early diagnosis by identifying high-risk individuals using health and genetic indicators.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop predictive models using structured clinical and demographic data
- Improve recall for elderly populations to prioritize early detection
- Explore continent-specific patterns and model generalizability

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)  
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering  
- One-Hot Encoding & Standard Scaling  
- Model Training: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting  
- Cross Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning  
- Performance Metrics: ROC-AUC, Recall, Confusion Matrix  
- Real-time Prediction Function (Simulated)

## 📈 Results
- **Best Model**: Gradient Boosting Classifier  
- **Recall (60+ patients)**: 80%  
- **ROC-AUC**: 0.8046  
- Real-time model supports scalable risk scoring for clinical environments
